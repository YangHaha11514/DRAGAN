A stable algorithm for GAN training

Note: We now have preliminary BogoNet results for improved WGAN. And we beat them in every single metric by a significant margin! Do keep an eye out for the next version of this paper

I am a big fan of open discussions/democratized research. Do post any questions you have at :-

We had an interesting discussion about connections between LSGAN, improved WGAN and DRAGAN (Ian Goodfellow and Martin Arjovsky were kind enough to give their comments). Check it out at :-
